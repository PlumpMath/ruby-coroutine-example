This example shows how to embed Ruby using different C coroutine libraries:

* libpcl    http://www.xmailserver.org/libpcl.html
* pthread   https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/
* ucontext  http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/System-V-contexts.html

And also using different stack allocation methods:

* static    The coroutine stack is baked into the shared object file.
* dynamic   The coroutine stack is allocated dynamically, at runtime.

And using my ruby_bind_stack() patch for Ruby, if present:

    http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/2294

To run this example, use the provided `run.sh` script:

    sh run.sh   # displays usage info

I hope this helps you learn how to embed Ruby inside C coroutines.  Enjoy!
