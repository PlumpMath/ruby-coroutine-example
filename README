ruby_bind_stack() usage example - libpthread POSIX threads
==========================================================

The "output.log" file contains the result of running
`script -c ./run.sh output.log` on my machine:

    Linux 2.6.31-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT i686
    Intel(R) Pentium(R) D CPU 3.00GHz

The last section in "output.log" corresponds to Ruby built from
SVN plus the "ruby_bind_stack.patch" file attached to this issue:

    http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/2294

Thanks for your consideration.  I hope this helps! :-)
